This project focuses on extracting movie data from IMDb for 2024, specifically focusing on the movie name and storyline. Using Selenium, the program will scrape IMDb to collect movie names and their associated storylines. The storylines will then be pre-processed and analyzed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Count Vectorizer. Using these methods, the project will calculate Cosine Similarity or other Machine Learning algorithms to recommend similar movies based on a given storyline. The project will provide an interactive user interface built with Streamlit where users can input a movie storyline and receive the top 5 recommended movies.
